* All scripts should search the current directory and, if necessary, its parent
  directories for radish.json. The script should be executed from the directory
  where the file is found. It should display an error message, if the file
  cannot be found.
* The compile and generate-modules commands should be integrated into a
  continuous build system.
* Once there is an integrated, continous build system, run it in a process that
  also serves the game in development mode. This makes it possible to output
  status messages (e.g. compilation errors) in the browser.
