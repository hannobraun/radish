* All scripts should search the current directory and, if necessary, its parent
  directories for radish.json. The script should be executed from the directory
  where the file is found. It should display an error message, if the file
  cannot be found.
* The compile and generate-modules commands should be integrated into a
  continuous build system.
* Once there is an integrated, continous build system, run it in a process that
  also serves the game in development mode. This makes it possible to output
  status messages (e.g. compilation errors) in the browser.
* Create funtion that generates component, entity or system modules. The
  template should not contain any more logic than a call to that function. This
  way, the template doesn't need to be updated, if the specifics of the modules
  change. Component module (as an example) could look like this:
  def.component "componentName", [], ->
      ...
* Rename output/generated to generated-code.
* Move entity id generation into the framework. Entity factories should just
  return a map of components.
* Create some kind of global entry point that enables developers to perform
  debugging actions in a running game from the browsers JavaScript console.
  Use cases:
  - Creating an entity.
